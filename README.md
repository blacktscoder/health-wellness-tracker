# 📊 Health Data API 🚀

Welcome to the **Health Data API** project! This is a simple GraphQL-based API that allows you to fetch health-related data for users, such as steps, calories, and water intake. This project is designed to help you easily access and monitor health data.

## 📝 Features
- 🏃‍♂️ Fetch daily steps data
- 🔥 Get calories burned
- 💧 Track water intake
- ⚡ Fast and efficient GraphQL queries
